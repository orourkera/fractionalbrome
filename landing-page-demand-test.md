# Fractional Home Landing Page Demand Test

## Concept Snapshot
- **Positioning**: AI-powered co-buying platform that pairs compatible home seekers, structures airtight agreements, and guarantees exits so they can own years sooner.
- **Primary Audience**: Renters aged 25–35 already sharing housing costs, dual-income professionals priced out of solo ownership, and young families open to co-living or investment-focused co-buying.
- **Core Promise**: "Move into your own home years sooner." Find a co-owner you can trust, close quickly, and know your exit is backed by guaranteed buyout options.

## Page Structure & Messaging
1. **Hero Section**
   - Headline: "Move into your own home years sooner with the right co-owner."
   - Subheadline: "Fractional Home matches compatible buyers, automates the legal work, and guarantees liquidity so you can build equity instead of paying rent."
   - Primary CTA button: `Join the Early Access list`
   - Secondary CTA (anchor to how it works): `See how co-buying works`
   - Social proof: rotating counter (e.g., "2,400 people joined the waitlist")

2. **Trust & Credibility Band**
